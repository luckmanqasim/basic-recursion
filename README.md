# Basic resurion algorithms I created for my Introduction to Python course.

# counter.py
This code recursively goes through a string and returns the number of consonants, vowels and other characters in the string, in form of a list.

# generate-for.py
This code takes an input number and returns, in descending order, all the binary numbers of the length represented by the input number.

# generate.py
Purely recursive version of the generate-for.py, this version uses a separate helper recursive function "prefix" instead of the for loop used in the previous code.

# prefix.py
This is an API that contains the helper recurisve function that is used in "generate.py". This code prefixes every item in the list, with a digit.

# spaced.py
This code creates a string from the input string, that is reversed, where each character is duplicated 3 times and then separated by a space
